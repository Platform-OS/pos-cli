The main focus of this release is to improve on speed and to eliminate some of the pain points of daily development.

## Layout and design
The layout and design were completely updated but all of the old functionality should be preserved. The new looks corresponds to platformOS branding a little better and the always-present header navigation should make switching between available tools quicker without a need to get through the home screen.

The app will check if it is connected to the instance (so, if the `pos-cli gui serve` is running) so you won't fall
